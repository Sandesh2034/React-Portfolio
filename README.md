# Sandesh Gurung's React Portfolio

## Introduction

Hello! I'm Sandesh Gurung, a passionate web developer with expertise in React. This repository contains the code for my React portfolio, developed as part of an assignment to showcase my skills and projects to potential employers.

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Router
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Design

For the design of my portfolio, I focused on creating a modern and professional look while adhering to mobile-first principles. I carefully selected a color palette to ensure a cohesive and visually appealing appearance throughout the site. The font size is optimized for readability, and the colors are chosen to prevent eye strain.
